# Vision-Based Robotic Grasp Detection using Deep Learning on the Cornell Dataset

Project Goals: This project aims to develop a deep learning model for vision-based robotic grasp detection. The primary goal is to enable a robot to autonomously identify optimal grasp positions, orientations, and widths for objects from RGB-D images. We will be using the Cornell Grasping Dataset and implementing GG-CNN style models.
